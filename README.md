creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with **object creation
mechanisms**, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation

### Structural Pattern

Structural design patterns focus on ways to manage **relationships between objects** so that your application is architected in a scalable way. A key aspect of structural patterns is to **ensure that a change in one part of your application does not affect all other parts**.

### Behavioral Pattern
 behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify **common communication patterns (how objects relate to each other)** between objects
