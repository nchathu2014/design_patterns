# Design Patterns
 There are mainly three patterns
 - Creational Pattern (Constructor,Module,Singleton,Factory)
 - Strcutural Pattern (Decorator,Flyweight,Facade)
 - Behavioral Pattern (Command,Mediator,Observer)
 
### Creational Pattern

creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with **object creation
mechanisms**, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation

### Structural Pattern

Structural design patterns focus on ways to manage **relationships between objects** so that your application is architected in a scalable way. A key aspect of structural patterns is to **ensure that a change in one part of your application does not affect all other parts**.

### Behavioral Pattern
 behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify **common communication patterns (how objects relate to each other)** between objects

### Reacp Basics
- Four ways to create objects (object literal,Construtor function,Object(),Object.create())
- Assigning and reading values from objects (dot(.) and bracket([]) notations)
- Define properties (Object.defineProperties)
- Inheritance (Object.create())
